# Adresu Plugin for strfry

[![My NIP-05](https://img.shields.io/badge/NIP--05-__@dukenukemmustdie.com-8E44AD?logo=nostr&logoColor=white)](https://dukenukemmustdie.com)

A policy plugin for the [strfry](https://github.com/hoytech/strfry) Nostr relay (though it can be used with any other relay after small adjustments).

This plugin acts as an orchestration layer for the filter library [Adresu Kit](https://github.com/lessucettes/adresu-kit). It extends the stateless filtering capabilities of the library with stateful moderation tools that require direct integration with a database and the `strfry` command-line interface. With Adresu Plugin, relay operators can enforce fine-grained policies for event acceptance, protect their servers from spam and abuse, and cultivate a higher-quality, safer environment for their users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Components

* **Filter Pipeline**: Executes a sequence of filters from `adresu-kit` and this plugin.
* **Stateful Moderation**: Provides filters that depend on an external state (a BadgerDB database).
    * **Banned Author Checks**: Rejects events from authors in a persistent ban list.
    * **Moderator Actions**: Allows a moderator to ban/unban users via Nostr reactions. Banning triggers a call to `strfry delete` to purge the user's events.
    * **Autoban**: Automatically bans users based on a configurable number of "strikes" (rejected events).
* **Hot-Reload**: The `config.toml` can be reloaded on the fly without restarting the plugin.
